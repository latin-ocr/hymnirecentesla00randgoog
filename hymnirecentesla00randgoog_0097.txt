3 Both oii and honey he provideo,
And sese] y through the desert guides;
His perfect work secures forme
Complete salvation, full end sree.
Dear Rook, and refuge of my soul,
To thee when angry bi lows roll,
I flee, and find asure retreat,
Before the blood-bought meroy seat.

4 And when the last great day shall come,
That senis to eaoh his final doom,
Let me beneoth thy ehadow hide,
And there eternelly abido.
There I'll adore, and ehout, and eing,
Giory to Christ, my Rook, my King3
While miilions joiri the eweet retiam,
Glory to God, Amen! Arnen!

1 The spacioue firmament on high,
With all the blue etheree} sky, '
And eparrgled heavene, a shining frome,
Their great Origine] proclaim.

2 Th’ unweary'd eun, from day to day,
Doee his Creator'e pcw’r display 3
And prrbliehes to every leod
The work of an Almightyhand.

3 Sooh ae the ev’ning shades prevaii,
The moon takes up the wondroue tale,
And nightiy to the iist'ning earth,
Repeats the story os hor birth:

4 While all the stare thet round her burn,
And all the planete in their turn,
Corriirm the tidinge os they roll,

And spread the truth srom pole to pole.
