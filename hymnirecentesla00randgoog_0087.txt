6 For me, Lerd Jesus. Thou hest died.
And Ι heve died inThee ;
Thou'rt risen ; my bande ere all untied,
And now Thou liv'st in me3
When purified, merle white, and tried,
Thy Glory then l'or me!

O
M· Nationel Hymn.

1 My country, 'tis ol thee,
Sweet land ol liberty,

Of thee I sing ;
Lnnd where my fathers died,
Lend of the prlgrirns pride,
From every mountain side
Let freedorn ring

2 My native country, thee-
Lantl ol' the noble, free-
Thy neme-I love,
Ilove thy rocks end rills,
Thy wnotls end tenrpled hills;
My beart with rapture thrills
Like thet above.

3 Let nnrsic swell the breeze.
And ring from all the trees
Sweet l'reednnr’s song:

Let mortel tongues nweke;
Let all thet breetbe partelre;
Let rocks their silence break—

'l'he sound prolong.

4 Our sethers’ Gotl, to thee,
Aether· el' liberty,
To thee we sing:
Long nrey orn· land be bright
With l'reeilorn'e lroly light3
Preteet us by thy might,
(treet (tort, our King.
