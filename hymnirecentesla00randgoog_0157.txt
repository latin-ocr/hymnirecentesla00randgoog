We love lo see ite colors glow;
But while we look they die 3 ’

In humble praise and prayer,
How long or short our lile may be,

When life and all its joys ere poet.

1 ’Twae on thal night, when doom'd to know
The eager rege ol ev’ry loe,
Thet mght in which he was hetrey'd,
The Saviour of the world took broad.

2 And, efler thanis and glory giv’n
To him thel rulee in earth and heev’n,
The symbol os his flesh he broke,
And thus lo all hie lollow’rs epoho:

3 “My broken body thus I give·
For you, lor all ; take, eal and live;
And ofl' the sacred rite renen,
Thot brings my wondroue love to view.

4 Then in hie hnnds the oup he raie’d,

’ And God anew he thanked and praie'd3
While hindnese in hie bosom glow’d‚
And from hie lips salvetion flow’d.
