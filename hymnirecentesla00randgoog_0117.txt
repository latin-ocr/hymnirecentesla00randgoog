And when the siorm of death
Rome sweeping by,
Whisper, OTruth of iroth,

Peene, ir is I.

1 When gethering storms eronndI view,
And days are dnrk and friends are few,
On Him I leon who not in vain
Experieneed every hnmnn pain3
He sees my wenis, niloys my feers, ³
And connis and mensures up my team.

Odriet ilie hope os ilie Diecooeoloie.

2 If eught should tempi my sonl to strny¹

From heavenly virtue's narrow way,
To fly the good 1 would pur'sue,

Or do the sin 1 would not do ;

Stin He who seit temptationis power
Shall guard me in that dangerous honr.

3 When vexing thoughts within mense,
And sore dismayed, my spirit dies,
Yet He who once vouohsafed to bear
The siokening angnieh of despair,
Slmll sweeily eootho, shall gently dry,
The throbbing heart, the streeming eye.

4 When,'sorrowing‚ o’er some stone I bend
Which covers all that was anieno,
And from his voice, his hand, his smile,
Divides me for a lime while,
. Thon Senem, seest the team I shed,
For thou didst weep o'er Lazarus dead.

5 And O, when I have safely passed
Through every conflict bnt the iant,
Stin, stili unehengimr, waioli beside
My painfnl bed, sor thou hirst diem
Thon point to reninis of oloudlese day,
And wipo the latest henr away,
