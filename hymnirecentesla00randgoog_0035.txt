2 she worst of eh diseeses
Is light, compared with sin;
On every part it seizeS,
But reges mest within:
’Trs palsy, plague, and sever,
And mmmm, arr cembined;
And none but a believer
The least relies can h'rrd.

3 From men great skiil professing

I thought a eure to gein;

But this proved more distressing,
And added te my pain :

Some said that nothing eiled me,
Seme gave me up for· lest:

Thus every refuge sailed me,
Andiail my hopes were crossed

4 Ar length, this great Physieian— .

How matchless is his grace 1-
· Accepted my petition,
And undertook my case3
First gave me sight to view him, ·
For sin my eyes had sealed, ·
Then hade me look unto him:
Ι leoked, and Ι was healed.

5 Δ dying, risen Jesus„

Seen by the eye of seith,

At once from danger frees us,
And seres theson! from death:

Come, then, to this Physieian;
His help he’ll sreely give ;

He makes no hard condiriom
'Tis only look end live.
