1 Tnsss is n land ol pure delighl‚

where saints imnrorlsl reign ;

Eternnl day excludes the night,
And pressores banish pain.

2 There everlesting spring allides,
And never-fodrng flowers:
Desth, like a narrow sea, divides
Thai heavenly land l'rom ours.

3 Sweel fields, beyond the swelling ssocd,
Stond dressed in living green:
Solo lhe Jews fair Conaan stood,
While Jordan rolled between.

4 Bul limorous mortale stari and shrink
To eross this norrow sea,
And linger. trenrhling‚ on thebrink,
And l'eor lolounoh awoy.

5 Ο, could we make onr donbls remove,-
Those gloomy doubts that riso,—
And see the Censen thal we iore
With unbeclouded eyes,-

6 Could we bul olinrb where Moses stood,
And view the londscspe o’en—
Nol Jordnn's stream, nor denth’s cold flood
Shonld lrighl us l'rom the shore.

1 Sweel honr ol prayerl Sweethour ol prayerl

Thnt cells me l'ronr a world ol care,

And hids nie sl nry Fnlher’s throne,
Malle all my wnnts ond wishes known;

In sessons ol distress and grief,
My soul has osten l'ound rebel:

And ost escaped lhe lenrpter's snare,
By thy return, sweel hour ol prayer.
