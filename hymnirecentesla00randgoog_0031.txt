3 Possim homines turbare,-

Propius tibi urget me ;

Vite opera vexare,-
Coehrm gratius secere.

Sum plenissime servatum
Nihii me sollicitet ;

Omnibus que preparatus,
Omnibus quae Deus det.

Fide, precibusque eam·
m nd eoelum propero,
Diem ad ueternum meum,
Me portante Domino.

Cito mee terminetur
Terrae eregriuutim
Spes in gioriem mutetur,
Laudem et precatio

1 Come, in J ehovah’s namo rejoioe;
Liu up in song your heart nnd voioe;
Let ull mankind gind tribute bring.
With glauness come end serve the Lord;
With hallowed mirth your joy record ;
Before His sace exulhng sing.

2 Our God is He—He gave us breath ;
O'er us He reigns; He sores from death ;
Creruion's Lord is He alone.
He made us ; aud He is our stay ;
He guards and nuides us, when we stmy ;
Seehs His lost sheep, and suves His own.

3 Come, crowd His gates with songs of praise,
And ful His courts with soundiug lays,
Procluim the Lord your Sovereign King:
His gmoe and truth. so sirm und sure,
His suithiuiness which must endum,
Through endiess ages wo shall sing.
