4 There shall I bathe my weory soul ·
In sess of heavenly rest,
And not a wave ol' trouble roll
Aeross my peaoelul breast.

M. solamen.

1 Ο Christ, what burdensbowed Thy Hesd
Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest in the sinner’s stood,
Didst bear all ill lor me.
A Victim led, Thy blood was shed ;
Now there’s no load for me.

2 Death and tho curse were in our oup
O chmel, ’twasfull for Thee;
But Thou host drained the last dark drop,
Tis empty now for me.

, Thet b1tter cup· lore drank it up ;
Now blessing’sdraught for me.

3 J ehovah liftcd up His rod-
Ο Christ, rt fell on Thoe l
Thou wast sore stricken ol Thy God;
Tlrere’s not one stroke for me,
Thy tears, Thy Blood, beneath it flowed;
Thy bruising healeth me.

4 Tho tempest’s awful voice was heard,
Ο Christ, it broke on Thee!
Thy open bosom was my word,
It braved the storm sor me.
Thy form was scorred, Thy vinage marred,
Now cloudless peace for me.

ς J ehovoh bede his sword owake—
Ο Christ, it woke ’geinst Theel
Thy blood the flamrng blade must slalre;
Thy heort its sheatlr must be;
All for my sake my peace to make,
Now sloeps thot sword for me.
