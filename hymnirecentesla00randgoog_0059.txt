4 He laid me on His slroulder,

And tenderly He kissed me; '
I fell my love grow holder

As ll e said how He had missod me.
And I’m sure 1 heard Hirrr sry,

As lle passed upon His way,
“0 wanderin souls come near me,

My shee sfrould never lear me

1 am tsse Shepherd true.”

5 Ilhouglrl His love would weaken
As more arrd more He knew rne;
Bul il burneth like a beacon,
And ils lighrancl heal go through mo.
,Λ nd 1 ever heard Him say,
As He passed upon His way,
“0 wandering souls come near me,
My shee should never lear me,
1 am tsse Shepherd true.”

6 Lel us do then, Christian brothers.
What will most and longesl plenae us3
Follow nol the ways ol others,
Bul trust ourselres lo J rsus,
We shall eyer hear Him say,
As He pasees on His way,
‘⁴ O wanderin souls come near me,
My sheegsffioulrl never l'ear me,
1 am l e Shepherd true.”
