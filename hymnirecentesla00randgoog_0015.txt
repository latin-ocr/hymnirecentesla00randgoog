YOU ehoe THE SJNGER, hor Thr: SONG.

Byr Byrnffcon omer, o D.

1 The eeged bird will swoetly ring,
As when h soored on joyous wing‚
And joined the choro! melodiee
With sweet resoundingsthroogh the shies.
Yoo may the bird enea-ge meanwhile,
Suh'ect it ro o doraoee vile;
Anci yet ’rwih hlioheeome nores prolong:
You coge the bird, but nottho song.

2 No hore of coge oon song confine,
For like the truth is song divine ;
And none can bare or sothero rino
Which erther truth or song ean bind.
In grove or enge, on land or sea, ¹
As free as air song floats es free.
Tho song the singer outlives long,
You oage the singer, not the song.

3 The song-birds sing in souls of some,
To soule of others never oome;
And sool where song is never heard
Is like the nege without the bird.
But where within their ootesthey raiae,
There lise beoomes e potho ot' prose,
E’en though enceged sing sweet end strong,
You coge the einger, not the song.

4 Biro· sing within the prison cell :
Where sioknese‚ want and sorrow dwell;
When vou admit them any where,

They shrg their songs of glodness there.
And in the soul those songs abide,
Though coge ond ringer east aeide;
From soul to eoul they pose along,

You coge the singer, hot the song.
