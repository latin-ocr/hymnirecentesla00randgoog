4 ’Twes rhe some love that spread the feast

Thet sweetly forced us in ;
Ehe we hed still refused to toste, ·
And perished in our sin.

5 Pity the notione. Ο our G0d3
Constrain the earth to come;
Send thy victorious word abromi,
., And bring the s'trangern home.

6 We long to see thy ohurohes full,
That all the chosen rece,
May, with ono voice, and heart, and eoul,

Sing thy redeeming grace.

1 Come, weary sinner, in whoee breast
A thousand thoughts revolve;
Come, with your guilt and seor oppressori
And make this last resolve :-

2 ‘¹ rh go to Jews, though my sin
Hnth like a mountain r0ee; ,
Iknow hie courte; l’ll enter in, ·
Whatever mar oppose.

3 “ I’ll prostrate lie before his throne,
And there my guilt confess;
I'll tell him I'm a wretch undeno,
Without his sovereign grace.

4 ⁴‘ I'll to the gracious King approach,
Whoee sceptre perdor given} ¹
Perha she may command my* touch,
An then the suppliant lives.

5 “ Perhaps he will admit my plen,
Perhaps will henr my prayer ;
But, if I perish, I will pmy,
And perish only there.
