Deam of Christian menda.

ι Why do we mourn departing friends,
Or shake at deaih's aiarms?
'Tis but the voice that J esus sends
To caii them to his arms.

2 Are we not sending upward‚ i00,
As issi ss time can move?
Nor would we wish the houss more slow,
To keep us from our Love.

3 Why should we iremble to convey
Their bodies to the tomb i
'Twas there the flesh oi J esus lay,
And lest a long periume.'

4 The graves of aii the saints he blest‚
And sostened every bed;
Where should the dying members resi
But with their dying Head i

5 Thenoe he arose, ascending high,
And showed our feet the way;

Up to the Loriour souis shall fly,
Ai the great rising day.

6 Then lei. the inst loud trumpet sound,
And bid our kindred rise:
Awake, ye natione under ground 3
Ye saints, ascend the skies.
