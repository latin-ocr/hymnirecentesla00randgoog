, 1 Awake, my som, and with the sun
Thy daily stage of duty run:
Shake off dull sloth and joyful rise

· To pay thy morning sacrifice

2. Wahe, and list up thyseh‘, my beart,
And with the angele bear thy part,
who all night long unwearied sing
High praises to 'th eterna} King.

3 Glory to thee, who safe hast kept,
And hash refreshed me while I slept:
Grant, Lord‚ when Ι from death shall wake,
I may of endlens life parhake.

4 Lord, I to thee my vows renew3
Dispel my sins as morning dew ;
Guard my first springs of thought and will,
And with thyseh' my spirit fill.

5 Direct, control, suggest, this day,
All Ι design, or do, or say,

That all my Fowem with true delight,
In thy sole g ory may unite.

me Christian lyaffare.

1 Stand up, my mul, shake off thy feam,
And gird the gospel armor 0113
March to the gates of endless joy.
Where J esus, thy great Captain’s gone.

2 Hell and thy sins resist thy comem
But hell and sin are vanquished soes;
Thy Saviour nailed them to the crosa
And sung the triumph when he rose.
