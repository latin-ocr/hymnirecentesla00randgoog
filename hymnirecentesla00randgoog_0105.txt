For years are fleeting fast,

And soon, in solemn loneliness,
The river must be passed.

But Thou wilt. never leave me.
And though the wovesmll high,

1 know thou wilt. be neor me,
And whisper, ‘¹ lo is I.”

Lead Thou me on; ⁴

Leed Thou me on.
Keep Thou my seet3 I do not ask to see
The distant soene; one step enough for me.

Lead Thou me οη.

Pride ruled my will ι remember not post years,
