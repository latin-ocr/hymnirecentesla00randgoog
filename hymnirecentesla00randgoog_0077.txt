⁶ Shudder not to pass the stream:
Venture all thy esre on Him—
nim, whose dying love and power
Stilled its teselng, hushed its rear.

7 Sese is the expanded wave,
Gentle as a summer's eve ;
N ot one objectos hiscere
Ever suffered shipwreek there.

8 See the haven full in view;
Love divine shall bear thee through:
Trust to that propitious gale;
Weigh thy anchor, spread thy sail.

9 Seints in gesy, perfect made,
Wait thy passage through the shade;
Swistly to their wish be given;
Kindle higher joy in heaven.

Help us thy name to sing,

Fether all g10ri0us,
O'er all victorious,
Come, and reign over us,

Our sure defence be made,
Onr souls on thee be svsyed;
Losd, hear our cell.

Gird on thy mighty sw01·d;
