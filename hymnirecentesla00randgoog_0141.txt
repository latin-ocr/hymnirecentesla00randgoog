ΙΙΙ the Lord our leader he,
We may follow without leam
East or west, by laudor sea,
Home, wilh him rs evry where
When from Essau Jacob yfied.
Though his pillow was a stone,
And the ground his humble b'ed,
’ Yet he was nol. len alone.

2 Kings ure often walring kept,
Raekd wuh emes on heds ossi ΙΙΙΙ;
Never king like Jacob slepi,
Fu »r he lay (ΙΙ heavens (ΙΙΙ,
Lo! he saw e lndder rear d,
Reuehing Ιο the heavenly lhrone;

And my presence nith thee goes:
On thy hearl my love shall shine, ⁴
Arnd my arm subdueb bhy loes:
From my romise ooml'orl lake,
For my help' m trouble (ΙΙΙ,
Never will l thee l',0rsalre
Till Ihove uoeomplislr'dbll.”'

To the gospelbhroue of graeey
We are at the ΙΙΙΙΙΙΙΙ ΙοΙΙ.
