Coaaeh'ttoa qs tte Heatltea.

From Greeland’s icy mountaina
Frorn India's eoral strand,-
Where At'rica’s snnny t'onntains

Rolt oown their golden saud,-
From many an ancient river,

From rnany a palmy plain,—
They call ns to deliver

Their land t'rom error’e chain.

What thongh the spicy breezes
Blow solt o'er Ceylon's isle,

Thongh every prospect phasea,
And only man is vile;

In vain with lavish kindneea
The gitta of God are strown:

The heathen‚ in his blindneSS‚
Bows down to wood and stone.

Shall we, whose sauls are lighted

By wisdom from on high,
Shah we to man benighted

The light of lise deny?
Salvation Ι 0, salvation!

The joysnl sonnd proolaim,
Tin earth’s rernotest nation

Has learned Messiah's name.

wast, wast, ye winde, his story,
And yon, ye wetere, roll,
(nh, likea sea of glory,
lt spreade honr pole to pole ;
Tin o'er aar ransanred natnre
The hanrh, t'or einners stain,
Rodeerner. King‚ Creator,
[n blise returns to reign.
