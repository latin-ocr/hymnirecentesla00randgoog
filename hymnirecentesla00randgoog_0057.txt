“ Sister spirit, come away ;”
What is this absorbe me quite?-

Drowns my spirite, drawa my breath?

1 Ι vves wandering and verny,
When rny Seviour came uneo me,
For the ways or'ein seemed dreary‚
And the world hed ceaeed to weo me,
And 1 thought Ι heard Him say,
As He passed upon Hie wey,
“0 wandering souls come near me,
My s'rree should never seer· me,
. Ι am ege Shepherd true?

2 At first Ι would not heerken,
But put ofl'till temorrow;
Bur the way began to oerIren,
, And Ι grew siek with sorrow,
And Ι thought Ι heard Him sey,
As He passed upon Hie wey,

“ Ο ιναηάθιήηῗ eoule eorrre near me,

My sheess s rould never sear me,
I em t e Shepherd true.”

3 Ar lest Ι turned to listen,
His voice could ne’er deceive me;
Ι saw Hie kind eyee glisten,
·Se anxious ιο relieve me,
And I thought Ι heard Hinr say,
