Before his ber your ο iritn bring,
And none be soun ιο hear nr nave.

4 In that lone land of deep despair, ⁸
No Sabbath'e heavenly light shall nse,
No God regerd your bitter· prefer,
No Sartour cell yon to the s res.

5 Now God invites. how blest the day!
How sweet the gospel’t charming eound ;
Come, sinners‚ haste, 0, hante vway,
While yet a perdoning God is found.

r The day is past end gone,
The evening ehades appear:
Ο may we all remember well
The night of death drawn neer¹

2 We lay ourgarments by
Upon our beds ιο rest;
So death will teon dierobe us eil
Of what we here possess.

3 Lord keep ue sese thie night,
Secure from all our feers:
May engeis guard us while we sleep,
Till morning light appears.

4 And when we early riae
Το view the unweeried sun,
May we eet out ιο win the prize,
And after giory run.

5 And when our days ere οόι,
And we from time remove,
Oh may we in thy bosom rest,
The bosom of thy love
