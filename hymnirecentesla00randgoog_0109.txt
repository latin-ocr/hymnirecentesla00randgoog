’Midsv flaming worlds, in these array’d
With joy shall I list up my head.

For veho aught to my charge shall lay?
Fully absolved through these I em,
From sin and sear, from guill and shame,

Who from the Felher’s bosom came,
Who died sor me, even me, to atone,
Now lor my Lord and Gorl ‚1 own.

Whieh at the mem-seat os God,
Fer ever (loth sor sineere plead‚
