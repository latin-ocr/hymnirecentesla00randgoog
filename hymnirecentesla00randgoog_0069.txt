9 But who may bide that testing hour,
When Christ shall come in dreadl'ul power,
And sleeping dead are waking?
What shelter then shall sinners find?
What wrong elude th’ omniscient mind,
When God striot search is making ?

10 On thee. thou Son os God who died,
On thee alone, thou Crucified,
My hope is now depending.
When seated on thy judgment throne,
Thou wilt thy ransonred people own,
And give thern bliss unending.

11 Then thou wilt show thy grace to me,-
'Ihat grace all prociona rioeless, l‘ree,
Eleotin ,intere ing.
My doubts an feers no more molest;
My refuge is thy loving breast;
No other am Ι needing.

Is laid lor your saith in his excellent word!
What nrore can he say than to you he huth said-
You, who unto -lesus l'or rel'uge have fied?

2 In every condition—in sickness, in health,

In overty’s vale, or abounding in wealth,
Athonre and abroad, on the land, on the soa,—
As thy days may demandshall thy strength ever be.

The rivers ot' woo shall not thee ovorllow;
Forl will be with thee, thy troubles to blesa,
And sanotily to thee thy deepest distress.
