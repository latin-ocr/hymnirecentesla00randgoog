2 The work which his goodness began,

The arm ol his strength will eomplete;

His promise is rea and omen,
And never was forfeited yet;

Things future, nor things that are now,
Not all things below nor above,

Can make him his purpose forego,
Or sever my soul from his love.

3 My name from the palme of his hands,

Eternity will not erase;

Im ressed on his heart it remeius,
n marks ol inclellible grace:

Yes, l to the end shall endure,
As sure as the earnest is given3

More happy, but not more secure,
The glonfied spirits in heaven.

1 Guide me, Ο thou great Jehovah,
Pilgrim through this barren land;
Ι am wealr‚ but thou art mighty,
Hold me with thy powerlul hand;
Bread os Heaven,
Feed mo till I want no more,

2 Open nowtheorystal sountain, ’
Whenee the healing streams do flow;
Let the fiery‚ oloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through ;
Stron Delrverer,
Be thou still my strength and shield.

3 When Ι troad the vorge os Jordan,
Bid my anxious leurs subside;
Beer me through the swelling current,
Land me sale on Ganaan’s side;
Songs os praises,
1 will ever give to thee.
