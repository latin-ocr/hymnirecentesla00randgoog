Satan, with mulioious art,
Watohos euoh unguarded purt3
But from Sutnn’s malioe free,

Nono betray us into sin,
Like tho ioes that dwell within:

Yet let nothing opoil our Εεθὲἓω

r Hush my deur, lie still and number,
Holy anzuh guard thy bed,
Heni-only lestingi without number
- Gontly faliing on thy heau.

3 Slekelp, my habe, thy food und rniment,
ouse and home thy friends provide;
And without thy oure or payment
All thy wants nro weil supplied.

3 How much better thou’rt attendet,
Thon the Son oi God could be,

When from heaven ho deseended,
And became nohrld like thoe.

4 Soft und easy is thy orudle‚
uoarse and hard thy Saviour iny;
When his birth-placo nuo n stable,
And his soitest bed was hay.

5 Was it nothing but a manger,
Cursod oinners could otford,
