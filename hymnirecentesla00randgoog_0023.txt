2 Thoughlikeawaoderer,
Weary and lone
Darlmem comes over me,
My rest a stone ;
. Yet in my dreame I'd be
Neuter, my God, to thee,
N earer to thee!

3 Then let my way appear
Steps unto heaven ;
All that thou sendest me
In merey given;
Angele ιο beckon me
Nearer, my Gotl, to thee,
N earer to theel

4 Theo, with my wtklng thoughts
Bright with thy praise,
Out ol' my stony griel's
‘¹ Bethel ’' l’ll mise ;
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, ιο thee.
Nearer ιο thee l

5 Or, is on joysul wing,
Cleaving the sky,
Suo, moon, and stare sorgot,
Upward I fly,
Still all my song shall be
N earer, my (lod, ιο thee,
Nearer ιο thee!

1 Just as Ι am—without one lea,
But that Thy blood was sEed lor me,
And that Thou bidst me come ιο Theo l
Ο, Lamb of (lod, I oomel

2 Just as I am- and waiting not
To rid my eoul ol one darl( blot,
To Thee whose blood oon cleanse each spot t

Ο, Lamb ol' God, 1 come!
