3 Thon let my soul march boldly on,—
Press sornard to the heavenly gate;
There peaoe and joy eternal reign,
And glittering robes sor conquerons wnit.

4 There shall I wear a starry crown.
And triumph in almighty grace,
While ull the armies ot' the skins
Jcin in my glorious Leader’s praise.

19. Pardon preaileully implored.

1 Show pity, Lord; Ο Lord‚ forgive3
Let a repenting rebel live;
Are not thy mercios large and free?
May not a sinncr trust in tlree;

1 My crimes, though great, cannot surpass
The power and glory ol' thy grace ;
Great God, thy nature hath no bound;
So let thy pardoning lore be found.

3 0, wash my soul frorn every sin,
And make mv guilty conscience olean3
Here, on my beart, the burden lies,
And past offences pain my eyes.

4 My lips, with chame, my sins confess,
Against thy Lau, against thy grace3
Lord‚ should thy judgment grow severe,
Iam condemned, but thou art clear.

5 Should sudden vengeanceseize my brsath,
I must pronounce theo iust iu deat'n;
And if my soul wore sont to hell,
Tlry righteous law approvesit well.

6 Yet save a trembling sinuer, Lord,
Whose hope, still hovering round thy word,
Would light on some syoet Kromise there,
Some sure support against espen.
