1 There is a sonntain fitted with blood,
Drawn from Imrnanuel’s veins;
And sinners, plunged heneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

2 The dying thies rejoiced to see
That fonntain, in his day ;
Θ, may 1 there, though vite as he,
Waah all my sins away.

3 Thon dying Lamb, thy precions blood
Shall never losa its power,
Till all the ransomed chureh of God

Are saved, to sin nomme.

4 E’nr since, by saith, Ι saw the stream
Thy flowing wonnda supply,
Rerlnaming love has been my theme,
And shall be, till I die.

5 And when this faeble, faltering tangue
Lies silent in the grave,
Then, in a nobler‚ sweeter song,
1²11 sing thy power to save.

1 When I can read my title clear
To mansione in the ahian,

Ι bid hrrewell to every t'ear,
And wipe my weeping eyes.

The Hope os Hmvan.

2 Should earth against my soul engage,
And fiery„darts be hurled,
Then I can amitant Satan's rage‚
And face a frowning world.

3 Let cares, like a wild daluge. corne,
And sterms os sorrow fall !
May Ι but sata} reach my home,
My Gon, my heaven, my all.
