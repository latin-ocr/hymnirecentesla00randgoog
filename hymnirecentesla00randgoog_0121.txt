116

We henr within the solemn voice-
Ol her unending song.

3 For nol like kingdoms of the world,
The holy church os Godl
Tho’ earthquake shocks are threatening,
And tempests are amend,

4 Unshaken as eternal hille,
Immovable she stands
A mountain thal shall fill the earth,

σό Α house not made wilh hands.
· Prahellw Ιιονά, Omyeonl. ·
1 Awakn, my¹ soul, to joyful lays, ι
And smgl y great Redeemer'n prane;

He justly claime a song from thee ;
His loving kindness‚ Ο how free!

2 He snw me ruin'd in the fall,
Yet loved me, notwithstanding all;
He saved me from my lost estate;
His loving kindness, Ο how grean

3 'lhrou h numerous hosts of mighty fone,
Though earth and hell my way oppone,
He sasely leads my snul along;

His loving kindnem, O how strong!

4 When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
Has galher'd thick, and thunder’d loud,
He near m soul has always stood ;

His loving hindnessO how good!

5 Osten I feel my sinful beart
Prone from my Saviour lo depan,
But though I ost have him forgot,
His loving kindness changes nol.

6 Soon shall I pass the gloomy vale,
Soon all my mnrlnl powers must hin
0 mny my last explring brenth
His loving kindness sing in death!
