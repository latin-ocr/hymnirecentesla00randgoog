83‘ m noryoay, naamam,

ι Jerusalem, my happy home
Name ever dear to me;
When shall my labors ha've an end,
In' yoy, and peace, and thee?

a When shall these eyes thy heaven· built walls,
And arly gates behold?
'l'hy bulliarks with salvation strong,

And streets o lshining gold?

3 Oh when, thou city ol my eod,
Shail I thy oourts ascend

Where congregatione ne er break up,
And Sabbatha have no end?

4 There htappier bowers than Eden’ s bloom,
Νοι sm nor sorrow kn0w;
Blest seatsl through rude and stormy soenes,
Ionward press to you.

ς Why should I shrinlr from pain and ποθ,
Or feel at death dismay?
1 ve Oanaan s goodly land' m view,
And realms ol endless day.

6 Apostles, martyra, propheta there,
Around my Saviour stand;
And soon my friends ιιι Christ below,
Will yoint the glorians band.

7 Jerusalem, mv happy home,
My soul still panta lor thee,
Therr shall my abours have an end,
When I thy' yoys shall see.

84· lWratiayoarlaetse?

ι 0, what rs lile? ’tis like a flower
That bloseoms and rs gone·

It flourishes rts little bour,
With all ita beauty οιι;

Death eomes and. like a wintry day.
lt euts the lovely flower away,
