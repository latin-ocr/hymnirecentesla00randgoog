sublime truths ol Revelation in pure classica] Latin 3

may be found with bis liberties in construing his
original, it would bc abold critic who should
attempt to impeach bis Latlnlty. He and Calvin

employed upon the performance. The ltnles of
Prosody, which Ι had hitherto in a great measure
neglected, had to be reexanrined and studied up.
