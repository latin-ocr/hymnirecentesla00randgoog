2 Prayer melreo the darkened cloud withdraw ς
Preyer ohmbs the lodder Jacob saw,
QQQQQQQ

3 Rostraiuinffipruger we ceree to fight3

Preger ma est e Christiane ormor bright3
An Satan tremblee, when he sees
The weokest saint upon his knees.

4 Have you no words? Ah, think agaim
Worde flow opace when you complain,
And fill your follow-oreature's ear
With thored tale of all your care.

5 Were half the breath thus veinly spent,
To heaven in supplication sent,
Your oheerful song would oftener be,
‘⁴ Heer what the Lord has done for me Ι”

Not oehomed qs Curuo.

1 Jesus, and shall it ever be,
A mortol mon ashamed of Theo!
Ashamed of Thee‚ whom angele ruine,
Whose glories shine through endfees days.

2 Aehemed of Jesusl sooner ser,
Let evening blush to own a stur3
He sheds the beams of light divine,
O’er this benighted eoul os mine.

3 Ashamed of J eous! just assoon
Let midnight be aehomed of noon;
’Tin midnight with my soul till he,

' Bright Morning Star, bid darkness fiee.

4 Ashomed of Jerus! that deor Friend‚
On whom m hopes os heaven depend;
No! when llyrlueh. be thie my rhome,
Thau I no more revere hrs name.
