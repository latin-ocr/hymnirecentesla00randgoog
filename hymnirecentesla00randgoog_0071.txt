5 When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all-sufficient, shall be thy su ply;
The fleme shall nol hurl thee ; Ι only esign
Thy dross lo consume, and thy gold to refine.

6 Even down to old age· all my peossle shall prove
{lydsogfiffin eternal, unchanega le love;

7 Τὴθ soul that on Jesus harh leaned for repom,
I will not, Ι will nol desert to his foes;

'Thal soul though all hell should endeavorto shake,

I'll never, no, never, n0, never l'orsake.

Psalm Ο.

1 All poople that on earth do dwell,
Sing lo the Lord wilh oheerful voice,
Him serve with mirlh‚his praise forth tell,
Come ye before him and rejoice.

2 Know that the Lord is God indeed;
Without our aid he did us make;
We are his doch, he doth us seed,
And l'or his sheep he doth us lake.

3 Ο enter then his gates with praise,
Approaoh with joy his courts unl0;
Praise, laud , and bless his name always,
For it is seemly so to do,

4 For why? the Lord our Good is good,
Hrs mercy is l'or ever snre;
His truth al all limes firmly stood,
And shall from age lo age endure.

oary hails shall lheir lenrples adorn,
Like lambs they shall still in my bosom be borne.
