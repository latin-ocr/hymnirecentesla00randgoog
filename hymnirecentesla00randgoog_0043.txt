ς And when this flesh and heart shall leil,
And morial lile shall oease,
Ishall possess within the veil
A lile of joy and peaes.

6 The earth will soon dissolve like snow,
The sun lorbear toshioe;
Bul God, who called me here below,
Will he l'orever mine.

1 Glory to thee, my God, this night,
For all the blessings of the light:
Keep me, Ο keep me, Kihg of kings,
Beneath the shadow of thy wings.

2 Forgive me, Lord‚ for lhy deor Son.
The ills which 1 this day have done;
Thai with lhe world, mysell,a11dlhee,
Ι, ere I sleep, al peaes moy be.

3 Teech me to live thel I may dread
The grave as little os my hed;
Teooh me lo die that sol may

With joy behold lhe judgmenl day.

4 Be thou my Guardian while Isleep ;
Τὴγ watchl'ul station neor me keep,
My heerl with love celestio! fill,

And guard me from th’ approroh ol ill.

ς lord. let my heort forever share
The bliss ol' lhy palernol coro:
'Tis heaven on earth, ’lis heaven above,
Το see thy lace and sing thy love.
