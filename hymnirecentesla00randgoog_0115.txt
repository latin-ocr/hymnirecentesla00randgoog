Dark was the nighl;

Oars labor’d heavlly,
Foam limmered while,

Trembl the mariners,
Peril was nigh,—

Then said the God of gods
“ Peace, il is 1.”

Lower thy eresl5

Wail ol the tempeslwind
Be thou at rest,-

Sorrow can never be,
Darkness must fly,

When saith the Light cl lighls
Pence, itis is 1.

3Ι JesuS. Deliverer,
Come thou to me,
Soothe thou my voyaging,
Over lil'e’s nea :
