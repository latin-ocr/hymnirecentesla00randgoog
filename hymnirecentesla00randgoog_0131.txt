Το receive the hoavenIy stranger
Did they thus affront the Ioni?

6 Sosi, my child, Ι did not ohido thee:
Though my song might sound too hardz
’Τίς thy mother sits besides thee,
And her arms shall be thy guard.

7 Yet to read the shamesul story,
How the Jews abused their king,

How they served tho Lord of glory‚
Makes me angry while I sing.

8 Lo i he olumbers in a manger,
Where ihe horned oxen fed;
Peme, my darling. here's 110 danger,
Here’s no oxen near thy bed.

9 See the loveiy babe a-dressin ι
Lovely iniant iiow it smileff !

When he wept his mother’s blemin ,

Soothed and hushed the holy ehffd.

10 Twas to save thoe, child, from dying,

Save my deor from burning flame,
Bitter groans and endless crying,
Thai the blest Redeemer came.

11 Mo ’st thou live to know aud sear him,
rust and love him all thy days

Thon ἱο live sorever near him,

See is face and sing his praiso.

70· Exhortation to Prayer.

1 What various hind¹ranoos wo meet
In coming to tho morey-seat!
Yet who. that known the worth of prayer,
But wishes to be often there?
