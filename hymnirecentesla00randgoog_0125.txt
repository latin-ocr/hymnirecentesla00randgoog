66· Excellency os Christ.

1 0, could we speak the matohless worth,
0, could we sound the glories forth,
Which in our Seviour shine,
We'd soar and touch the heavenly stringo,
And vie with Gabriel while he singu,
In notes almost divine.

2 We'd sing the pretioue blood he syfilt—
Our ransom from the dreadful gur t

Ol sin end wrath divine;
We’d sing his glorious righteousness,
In whioh ell perfect, heavenly dress
We shall torever shine.

3 We’dsin the characters he bears,

And all t e forms ol love he weard,
Exelted on his throne;

In loltiest eongs ol sweeteet preire,

We would to ever-lestin days,

Make all his glories {norm⁸

4 Well‚ the delightlul day will come,
When our deer Lord will bring uo horne,
And we shall see his feoe;
Then with our Seviour, Brother, Friend,
A blest eternity we’ll spond,
Triumphent in his grace.
