1 Nay, I cannot tet thee ἕο,
Till a bleseing thou bestow ;
Do not turn away thy face.
Mine's an urgent pressing case.

2 Dost thou ask me who I am?
Ah, my Lord, thou know'et my name3
Yet the question gives a plera,
To support mp suit with thee.

3 Thou dist once a wreteh behold,
In rebellion blindly bold,
Scorn thy grace, thy power defy;
That poor rebel, Lord, was I.

4 Once a sinner near despair,
Sought thy merey-seat hy prayer;
Mercy heard and set him t'ree3
Lord that mercy came tome.

Many changes] have seen,
Yet have been upheld till n0w;
Who could hold me up but thou?

6 Thou hast help'd in ev'ry need ;
This emboldens me to plead:
After so much rnercy past,
Canst thou let me sink at laet?
