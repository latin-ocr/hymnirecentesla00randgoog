3 My plainte and prayere were vainly made:
Wrong still grevailed while yet Ι pmyetl ι

For od’e just condemnation :
Then einl‘ul doubts my mind enthralled3
The ehaoklee ol' my bondagc galled

My eoul to aggravation.

4 The lettere strong that held me laet
Ietrove in vain l'rom me to east,-
My etriving made them etronger.
Then came a voice: “'Tie not for thee
To haste the wrath withheld bv me,
Contend, my child, no longer.'¹

5 With strength voueheated my chaine Ibroke5
And sudden} my spirit woke-
A light was round me thiningl
“ Heneelorth‚'' Ι nied, ⁴⁶ to thee I'll rarae,
Ο God, a song ot' grateful plaiae,
And hush all raeh repining.''

6 Ncw saith ie firm, that in the end
God'e justice will the Right del'end,
And make due reparation.
For God is such, he needeth not
To haste the duom ol' evil wrought,
To prove his indignation.

7 All wrong now hid in earth's dark night
Will be revealed in clearest light,
And none ean then dissemble. .
Then righteouenese shall win the day,
And God no longer will delay
To make the guilty tremble.
