1 In de dark wood, no Indinn high,
Den me look hebun end send up ory,
Upon my knee so low ;
Dat God on high in ehiny piace,
See me in night wid ieery fece,
My beart him tell me eo.

2 Him send him angel take me care,
Him oome himself and hemum prayer,
Ii Indien heari do prey ;
Him see me now, Him know me here,
Him say, “ Poor Indiam neber seer,
Me wid you night end dey.”

3 So me iub God wid ineide heart,

And me lub he, and det be good,
Me prey him two time more.

Den him no leebe me, so him eey,
‘⁸ Me wid you till you die ;''
Den take me up to shiny place,
See white men, red man, bleok men face,
Ali happy like on high.
