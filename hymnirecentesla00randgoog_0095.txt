And brings me necrer Thee,
Blest Semoni, neerer Thee,

THE ROOK OF AGES.

‘¹ For they drant- of that spiritual Rock that followed mem,
· and wat Rock wcc Oltviet.''—1 θον. c. 4.

ι Thou Roch os Ages, still the same
As when the lcwly Jesue came,
Tc J ordan’s stream tc be baptizem,
And by the world to be despised.
On thee I rest, who not in vain,
Bore all my sin end sheme and pain;
That Rcck, srom whence those watem flow,
Which heclmy wounds and ciecnse me too.

Fixed on this everiesting Rock,

My sou] defles earth's rudest shock ;
Though men cnd demone ali combine,

I cm secure since Christ is mine.

While cn my pilgrimage below

The streame thet srom that Rcch do flow,
Renew my strength from day to (hty,
And chccr me 011 my heavenward wey.
