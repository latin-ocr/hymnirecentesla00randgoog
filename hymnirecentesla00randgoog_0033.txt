Merciee yratesully aclcnowledyed.

1 Come, thou Fount of every messing,

Tune my ,henrt to sing thy grece;
Streams ol' merey‚ never eeoeing,
Call lor songe of loudest proise.

2 Teaoh ine sorne melodins mensure,
Sung hy reptured saints alwn¹e;
Fill my soul with sacred plensnre,
While I sing redeeming love.

3 By thy hand sustoined defended,
Sale through life, thiis fer, Iv'e come;
Sal'ely, bord, when lil'e ie ended.
- Bring rne to rny heavenly horne.

4 lesus sought rne when a strengen,
Wnndering l'rom the fold ol' God;
He, to save nr y sonl l'rom danger,
Interposed hie precious blood.

5 0, to grace how great a debtor‚
Dnily I'nr constreined to be!
Let thy grace, Lord, like o letter,
Bind nry wandering heart to thee.

6 Prone to wonder, Iord, I leel it;
Prone to leave the God Ι love;
Heor's my hea1·t; Ο take end seal it;
Seal it l'rom thy conrts above.

1 How lost was my condition
Till lesus nrade rne whole!
Theseis hut one Physioian
Can eure a sin-sich soul:
Next door to death he l'ound me,
And snatohed me l'ronr the grave,
To tell to all eround me
His wondrous power to save.

Christ tlte yreat Physirr'an.
