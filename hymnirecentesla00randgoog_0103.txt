Thy righteoumess, Thy pardon,
Thy precious blood must be

My only hope and comfort,
My glory and my ploa.

2 I could not do without Thoe,

I cannot stand alono ;

1 have no strength or goodness,
No wisdom ol my own.

But Thou, belowed Sowiour
Art all in all to me,

And weokness will be ower,
If leaning hard on Theo.

3 I could not do without Thoe!
For oh 1 tho way is long,
And I am osten weary,
And sigh replaoen son .
How could I do withoutgrhee?
I do not know the way

3

Thou knowest ond Thou lowest,
And wilt not let mo stray.

4 1 could not do without Theo!

Ο Jews, Saviour door!

E’en when my eyes ore holden⁷
Ι know that Thou art near.

How dreory and how lonely
This changesul lise would be

without the sweet communion,
The secret rost with Theo.

5 I could not do without Theo!
No other friend oan read
The spirit’s strange deep longings,
Interpreting its need.
No human hewrt could enter
anh dim reooss of mine,

And sootho and hush and oolm it,
0 blessed L01·d‚butThino!
