5 They who know the Suvlour's name,
Are for all events prepar'd ;
What ean changes <lo tothem,
Who have such a guido und guard?
Should the traverso eurth urouud,
To the larlrler still they oome;
Ev’ry epotis holy ground,
God is there—aud he’s their home.

1 When loseph hio brethren behold
turicremam trembling with leur,
His heart with compumion was fill'd,
From weeplng he could not forbear.
Α while hie belluviour was rough,
To bring their past sin to their mind3
But when they where humbled enough,
He hosted to shew himself kind.

2 How little they thought it wne he,
Whom they hod ill-treated aud sold!
How great their confusion must be,
As soon us his name he had told!
⁴‘ I’m Josefrh your brother,'⁰ he said,

“ And etil to my hourt ζου aro dear3
You sold me, und thoug t I uus dead,
But God, l'or your salros, seut me here.”

3 Though greatly distrtesed before,
When oharg'd with purloinlng the cup,
They now were confounded much more,
Not one ol them durst to look up.
“ (lun Joseph, whom we would have elain,
For ire us the evll we did?
Αῐιὲ will he our households maintain?
O, this is r. brother indeed! ”
