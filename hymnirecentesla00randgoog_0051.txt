3 Thy blood shull tune my tongue to pra.ise;
Thy oross shall wake my joyt'ul loys.
Nor thronis, nor flames, nor glearning sword,
Shell drive me l'rom thy oross, Ο Lord.

4 Thy blood, 0 Christ, heth power tosmite
The hosts ol' hell, to ourb their might.
Both lew und justice it maintains,

Yet trees the oulprit from his chains.

5 Thy blood oen melre thee friends of foes;
Can resoue souis l'rom endless woes. ¹
O mutohless blood! what might is thinel

What wondrous blood is blood divinel
