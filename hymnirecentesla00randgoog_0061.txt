2 The moe appointed 1 hove run!
The comhnt’s o’er the prizo is won;
And now my witness is on high,
And now my reeord’s in the sky.

3 Not in mine innocenoe Ι trusl5
1 bow before thee in lhe dustl ·
And through my Seviour's blood alone
I look for meroy at thy throne.

4 I leuve lhe world without e tear,
Save lor the friends I held so deer;

· To heal their sorrows. Lorii, descend,
And to lhe friendless prove n friend.

5 Icome, Ι come, ul lhy command,
I give my s irin to thy hand;
suetonionll lhine everlnsting arms,
And shreld me in lhe lusi olnrms.

6 The hour of my departure's oome;
Ι hear the voice that calls me home;
Now. Ο my God! let trouble cense;
Now lel thy servant die in peace.

1 0 thou in whose presence my soul takes delighl,
On whom in affliction I call,
My cornl'orl hy dny end my song in lhe night,
My hope, my salvation my nll.

1 Where dost lhou elnoonlide resorl wilh thy sheep,
To l'eed on the pastores of love?
For why in the valley os death should Ι weepi
Or elone in the wilderncss rove?

3 Oh, why should 1 wender an elien from thee,
Or cry rn the desert sor breed?
Thy roes will rejoice when my sorrows they seo
And smile ut the leurs I have shed.
