wo busy Boe

1 How doth the little busy bes
Improve euch shinin honr,
And gether honey all ille (lay,
From every opening flovver.

2 How skillsully she builds her cell,
How neat she spreads her wax,
And lubours hard to store ir well,

With the sweet food she mukss.

3 In vorke of labour or of skill,
I would be busy loo ;
For Satan finds some mischief still,

For idle hands to do.

4 In boolrs or works or heulthsul play,
Let my first years be psst3

'l'bat I mffidgive lor every day,

Some g account at last.

Aquino quarellam ond fiylrlluy

1 Lei dogs delighl to bork and bite,
For (lod heth morlo them s0;
And bears und lions growl ond fight,
For 'lis their nature to.

2 But children you should never lsi
Such angry passione rise;
Your little hands were novor made
To leur sach others eyes.

3 Lel love through all your actions run,
And all our words be mild ;
Live like lle blessed Virgin’s Son,
nvo sveni und lovsly curlo.
