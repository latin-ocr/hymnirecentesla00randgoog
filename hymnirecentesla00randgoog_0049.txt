20⁶ Plan bonaenly home.

‚ 1 There is a house not malle with hands,
Etennal and on high ;

And here my spirit walling stands,
Till God shall bid it fly.

2 Shorlly thisp1·isi0n0f my clay
Must be dissolved and sall;

Thon, Ο my soal. with joy obey
Thy heavenly Father’s eall.

3 ’Tis bo, by bie alminhty grace,
That forms thee fit sor heaven,
And, as an earnesl of the place,
Has his own Spirit given.

4 We welk by saith ofjoys to come:
Failh lives upon lna word ;
But while the body is our hom'e,
We’re absent from the Lord.

5 'Tls pleasant lo believe thy grace,
But we had rather see ;
We would be absent from the fleeh,
And present, Lord, with thee.
