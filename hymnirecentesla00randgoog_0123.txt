1 (iod is the refuge of his saints,
When storms ol sharp distr-ess invade ;
Ere we ean offer our com laints‚
Behold him present wit his aid.

2 raud may the troubled ocean roar;
In sacred peace our souls abide,
While every nation, every shore,
Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide.

3 Tharais a stream whose gentle flow

’ Su plies the eity ol our G0d;
bisalove, and joy still gliding through,
And watering our divine abode.

4 That sacred stream, thine boly word,
Supports our saith, our fear controls;
Sweet peace thy promises afford,
And give new strength to fainting sauls,

5 Zion enjoys her Monareh’s love,
Secura against a threatening hour;
Nor can her firm foundation move,
Ρ Built on his truth‚ and armed with power.

1 How pleasant, how divinely sair,
OLord pf hosts, thy dwellings arel
With long desire my spirit saints
To meet th’ assemblies of thy saints.

2 My flesh would rest in thine abode ;
My anting beart ories out sor God; ⁴
My god, my King. why should Ibe
So far from all my joys and thee.

3 Blest arethe saints who dwell on high,
Around thy throne above the sky;
Thy brightest glories shine above,
And all their work is praise and love.
