4 Thtis dragg’d hy my conscience, I came,
And leden with guilt. to the Lord‚
Surroonded with terror and shame,
Unoble to utter a word.

At first he look'd etern and severe,
What anguish then pieroed my heart!
Expeoting each moment to hear

The sentense “Thou cumed, depart Ρ

5 But, oh! what surprise when he spoke,
While tendemoee beam'd in his saoe;
My heart then to pieoeo wee broke,
O’erwhelmed and confottnded by graoe;
‘⁴ Poor sinner, I know thee full well,

By thee Ι was sold and was eloim

But 1 died to redeem thee from hell,
And mise thee in glory to reign.

6 I’m Jeeus, whom thou hest blasphem'd,
And oruoiiied osten asresh;
But let me henoeforth he esteem’d
Thy brother, thy bone, and thy fleeh :
My pordonI sreer bestow,
Thy wante 1 will sully supply;
I'll uide thee and guard thee below,
An soon will remove thee 011 high.

7 Go publish to einnere around,
Thet they may be wiliing ιο come,
The mero which now you have found,
Anti tell them that yet there is room.”
() smnersl the messege obey,

No moro vain excuses Eretenth

But como without furt er delo ,
To Jeene our brother and srien .
