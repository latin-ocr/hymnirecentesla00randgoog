2 Ohow shall words, with equal warmth,
The gratitude declare
That glows within my ravish’d heartl
But Thou canst read it there.

3 Thy Providenoe my life sustaiu’d,
And all my wants remeet,
When in the silent womb I lay,
And hung upon the breast.

4 Το all my weak complaints and ories
Thy meroy lent an ear.
Ere yet my feehle thoughts had leam’d
To form themselves in prayer.

5 Unnumbered comforts to my soul
Thy tender eane hestow’d,
Before my infant heart conoeiv'd
From whom these comforts flow'd

6 When in the slipp'ry paths of youth
With heedless steps I ran ;
'lhine arm, nasoon, eonvey’d me safe,
And led me up to man:

7 Through hidden dangers‚ toils, and deaths,
It ently elear'd my way;
And tiirough the pleasing suares of vioe,
More to be fear'd than they.

8 When wom with sichnss, oft hast thou
With health renewed my faee3
And, when in sins and sorrows sunk,
Reviv’d my soul with graue.

9 Thy bounteous hand with wordly hliss
Hath made my cup run o'er3
And, in a kind and faithful friend,
Hath doubled ull my store.

ιο Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
My daily thanks employ;
