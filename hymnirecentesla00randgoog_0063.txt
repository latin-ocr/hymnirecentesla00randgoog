4 Ye daughters os Zion, declaro have you seen
The Ster that on Israel shonei
Sny il' in your leuis my beloved hus been,
Or where with his floclrs he has gone?

5 This is my beloved‚ his form is divine,
His vestrueuts shed cdors around;
The looks ou hishecvl are ns grnpes on the vine,
When autumn wilh plenty is crowned.

6 The roses ol Shnron the lilies that grow,
In the vales, on the henks of the strenms,
On his cheeks in the boculy of excellence glcw,
And his eyes are as quivere of beams.

7 His voice as the sound os the dulcimer susci,
Is heard throu h the chumbers of death ;'
'Ihe Cedcrs of ,bauco bow uthis ieet,

And the eir is perfumed wilh his brealh.

8 His lips us a lountniu os ri hloousness flow,
Thet wuters the gnrden oigrace ; ι
From which rherr solvuhon the Genlrles shall
And baskliiiciii’e smiles of his face.

9 He looks.end ten thousands ol engeis rejoioe,
And myriods weit for his word ;
Hesperiis, and elemily filled wirh his voice,
Reechoes the proise ef her ¹Lord.

Does his successive 'ourueys ruu;
His kingdom siretcir from shore to shore

2 For him shall endless prayer be made,
And endless prcises crown his head 3
His nome. like sweel persume, shcll risc
