And leed me with a shepherd's oare;

And gulde me with a watohlul eye,
My noonday walks he shall attend,
And all my midnight hours defend.

Or on the thin'sty mountain pant,
To fertile vales and dewy meads

Mt· weary. wandering steps he leode,
Where peaoelul rivers, solt and alon,
Arnid the verdant landsoape flow

With gloomy horrors overspread,
My steadfast heart shall sear no ill,
For thom Ο Lord‚ art with me still ; -
Thy friendly orook shall give me ald,
And gulde me through the dreadlul shade.

4 Though in a bare and rugged way,
Through devious lonely wilds I stray.

Thy gresenee shall my pains beguile,

The arran wilderness shall smile,
With sudden greens and herbage orowned,
And streame shall murmur all around.

OSaviour ol the lostl
Whose precious blood redeemed me
At such tremendous eost.
