Scy why do 1 lengulsh ond pino,
And why ore my wintere so long?

8 Odrive these dcrk clouds from my sky,
Τιιῖί soulchcering presence restore ;
Or ιο ο me uoto thee on h1gh,

Where winter and clouds are no more.

And for my rehes wlll surely Ἔρωτι

Though cisterno he broken, ond creatores cll soil,
The word he hoe spoken will surely prevoil.

He'll leave me, οι lest, in trouble ιο sink ;
Each eweet Ebenecer l have in review

When Solcn's blind slave I sported wit wrath ;
And can hc hove taught me ιο trust in his nome
And thus lor have broughtme ιο put me ιο chemel

Tem tahon or pain? He told me no leso;
